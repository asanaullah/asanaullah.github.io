I"m<p>Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are rapidly becoming first-class citizens in the datacenter, instead of niche components. This is because FPGAs i) can achieve high throughput and low latency by implementing a specialized architecture that eliminates a number of bottlenecks and overheads of general purpose computing, ii) consume little power and, by extension, have a high power-performance ratio, iii) have high-speed interconnects and can tightly couple computation with communication to mask the latency of data movement, and iv) can be configured so that each design is tuned for individual use cases.</p>
